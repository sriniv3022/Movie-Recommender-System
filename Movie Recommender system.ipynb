    "> **Project Goal:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project is to develop a recommendation system that suggests the top 5 movies to users based on collaborative filtering techniques: Item-based Collaborative filtering and User-based Collaborative filtering.\n",

    "> **Methodologies:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Data Cleaning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Merged 3 datasets: movies.csv, ratings.csv and links.csv and dropped inappropriate columns. The resultant dataset has  100836 rows and 5 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Data Preparation:**\n",
    "* Prepared the data such that rows has user ID and columnshas Movie and the values are filled with corresponding rating \n",
    "* Prepared the movie data where it has two columns: Movie; ID\n",
    "\n",
    ">> **Helper functions:**\n",
    "Got all helper functions over here: standEst(), svdEst(), pearsSim(), distCosine(), cross_validate_user(), print_most_similar_movies_cosine(), get_similar_movies_cosine(), print_most_similar_movies_pearson(), get_similar_movies_pearson()\n",

    "* Predicted missing rating using SVD Estimate Method\n",

    "Since the Standard Estimate method took more than 2 hours to compute missed rating, removed the movies which have have less that 100 ratings. 9719 movies have been reduced to 138 movies. With 138 movies, the Standard Estimate method took approximately 13 mins to compute missed ratings.\n",

    "\n",
    ">> **Conclusions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**I.**\n",
    "The SVD Estimate method outperforms the Standard Estimate method in terms of computational efficiency. When predicting ratings for 138 movies by 610 users, the Standard Estimate method took approximately 14 minutes to complete, while the SVD Estimate method accomplished the same task in just 99 milliseconds. This significant difference in computational time highlights the superiority of the SVD Estimate method in terms of efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**II.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The item-based recommendation engines were evaluated using four different combinations: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standard Estimate Method with Cosine Similarity\n",
    "2. Standard Estimate Method with Pearson Correlation\n",
    "3. SVD Estimate Method with Cosine Similarity\n",
    "4. SVD Estimate Method with Pearson Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "For each combination, a selected movie (in this case, \"Alien (1979)\") was used as a query to recommend similar movies. The recommendations were obtained using manual calculation and inbuilt functions for similarity measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all four combinations, the recommended movies were listed based on their similarity to the selected movie. The recommendations were provided using both manual calculations and inbuilt functions for cosine similarity and Pearson correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, it can be observed that the recommended movies are consistent across all combinations. The top recommended movies are mostly the same, regardless of the similarity measurement method or the estimation method used. This indicates that the recommendation engines are providing reliable and consistent results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The item-based recommendation engines showed effectiveness in identifying similar movies based on the selected movie. Whether using the Standard Estimate Method or the SVD Estimate Method, and whether employing Cosine Similarity or Pearson Correlation, the engines produced comparable recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these item-based recommendation engines demonstrate their capability to generate accurate and relevant movie recommendations. The choice between the Standard Estimate Method and the SVD Estimate Method, as well as the similarity measurement method (Cosine Similarity or Pearson Correlation), can be based on factors such as computational efficiency and specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**III.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that both the `standEst` (Standard Estimate) and `svdEst` (SVD Estimate) methods perform reasonably well in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for the item-based recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MAE for the `standEst` method is 0.1794, while the MAE for the `svdEst` method is slightly higher at 0.1802. The lower the MAE value, the better the accuracy of the recommendation system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the computational times, the `standEst` method took approximately 5 minutes and 21 seconds, while the `svdEst` method took significantly longer at approximately 10 minutes and 18 seconds. The increased computational time of the `svdEst` method can be attributed to the more complex calculations involved in the SVD-based estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, both methods provide similar performance in terms of recommendation accuracy, with the `standEst` method having a slightly lower MAE. However, the trade-off is that the `svdEst` method requires significantly more computational time.\n",

    "\n",
    "Item-based collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommender systems to provide personalized recommendations based on the similarity between items. It relies on the assumption that if two items are frequently rated similarly by users, they are likely to be related or have similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The item-based collaborative filtering algorithm operates in two main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity Calculation: The first step involves computing the similarity between items. This can be done using various similarity measures such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation. The similarity is computed based on the ratings given by users to different items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation Generation: Once the similarity between items is calculated, the algorithm identifies items that are most similar to a given item. When a user expresses a preference for a particular item, the algorithm looks for items that are highly correlated with that item. It then recommends those highly correlated items to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Item-based collaborative filtering has several advantages. It is relatively simple to implement and is particularly effective when dealing with sparse datasets, where there are many more users than items. It also avoids the cold-start problem, which occurs when new items are added to the system without any ratings or information. In this case, the similarity between items can still be computed based on existing ratings, allowing for recommendations to be generated.\n",
